# Task List 06 — Algebra of Events and Conditional Probability

> **Note:** This task list is still being developed. For now, please don’t work on it yet. :)

## Introduction

Probability theory does not only study numerical values of probabilities. It also studies the **structure of events** and the relations between them.

Before computing probabilities, one must understand:

* what an event is,
* how events can be combined,
* how to describe events using set operations,
* how probabilities behave under union, intersection, and complement,
* how additional information changes probability.

This task list develops two closely connected topics:

* **algebra of events**,
* **conditional probability**.

The main goal is to learn how to move fluently between:

* verbal descriptions of events,
* set-theoretic notation,
* probability formulas,
* and concrete probabilistic models.

# Theoretical Background

## Random Experiment, Sample Space, and Events

A **random experiment** is a process whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty in advance.

The **sample space**, denoted by

$$
\Omega
$$

is the set of all possible elementary outcomes of the experiment.

An **elementary event** is a one-element subset of the sample space.

An **event** is any subset of the sample space.

Thus, if

$$
A \subseteq \Omega
$$

then $A$ is an event.

---

## Event as a Set

In probability theory, events are treated as sets. Therefore, operations on events are the same as operations on sets.

If $A$ and $B$ are events, then we can form:

* the union,
* the intersection,
* the complement,
* the difference.

This set-theoretic point of view is the foundation of the algebra of events.

---

## Union of Events

The union of two events $A$ and $B$ is the event that at least one of them occurs.

It is denoted by

$$
A \cup B
$$

and means:

* $A$ occurs,
* or $B$ occurs,
* or both occur.

---

## Intersection of Events

The intersection of two events $A$ and $B$ is the event that both occur.

It is denoted by

$$
A \cap B
$$

---

## Complement of an Event

The complement of an event $A$ is the event that $A$ does not occur.

It is denoted by

$$
A^c
$$

or sometimes by

$$
\Omega \setminus A
$$

depending on notation.

---

## Difference of Events

The difference

$$
A \setminus B
$$

is the event that $A$ occurs but $B$ does not.

---

## Mutually Exclusive Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** if they cannot occur together.

This means

$$
A \cap B = \varnothing
$$

Such events are also called **disjoint**.

---

## Certain Event and Impossible Event

The **certain event** is the whole sample space:

$$
\Omega
$$

The **impossible event** is the empty set:

$$
\varnothing
$$

Their probabilities satisfy

$$
P(\Omega)=1
$$

and

$$
P(\varnothing)=0
$$

---

## Basic Properties of Probability

A probability measure assigns to each event $A$ a number

$$
P(A)
$$

such that:

$$
0 \le P(A) \le 1
$$

$$
P(\Omega)=1
$$

and for mutually exclusive events,

$$
P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)
$$

More generally, if $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n$ are pairwise disjoint, then

$$
P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+\dots+P(A_n)
$$

---

## Complement Rule

For every event $A$,

$$
P(A^c)=1-P(A)
$$

This is one of the most frequently used identities in elementary probability.

---

## Inclusion–Exclusion Formula

For any two events $A$ and $B$,

$$
P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)
$$

This formula corrects for double counting.

---

## Conditional Probability

Often the probability of an event changes when we know that another event has already occurred.

The **conditional probability** of $A$ given $B$ is denoted by

$$
P(A \mid B)
$$

and is defined by

$$
P(A \mid B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

provided that

$$
P(B)>0
$$

---

## Multiplication Rule

From the definition of conditional probability, we obtain

$$
P(A \cap B)=P(B)P(A \mid B)
$$

and equivalently

$$
P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B \mid A)
$$

This rule is fundamental in multi-stage random experiments.

---

## Independence of Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.

Mathematically, this means

$$
P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B)
$$

If $P(B)>0$, then this is equivalent to

$$
P(A \mid B)=P(A)
$$

It is important to distinguish **independence** from **mutual exclusivity**:

* mutually exclusive events cannot occur together,
* independent events do not influence each other probabilistically.

---

## Law of Total Probability

Suppose that events

$$
B_1,B_2,\dots,B_n
$$

form a partition of the sample space, that is:

* they are pairwise disjoint,
* their union is the whole sample space.

Then for any event $A$,

$$
P(A)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A \mid B_i)P(B_i)
$$

This formula is especially useful when a problem naturally splits into cases.

---

## Bayes’ Formula

If

$$
B_1,B_2,\dots,B_n
$$

form a partition of the sample space and $P(A)>0$, then

$$
P(B_k \mid A)=\frac{P(A \mid B_k)P(B_k)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A \mid B_i)P(B_i)}
$$

Bayes’ formula allows us to reverse conditional information.

---

## How to Read Event Statements Correctly

In many exercises, the main difficulty is not the computation itself, but translating words into event notation.

Examples:

* “at least one” often suggests a complement,
* “exactly one” requires separating cases,
* “both” means intersection,
* “at least one of” suggests union,
* “given that” signals conditional probability.

The ability to move between verbal and symbolic language is one of the core aims of this list.

# Task 14 – Optional Interactive Exploration

Design a minimal interactive HTML/JavaScript tool illustrating the ideas of this list.

The webpage should allow the user to choose a simple random experiment, for example:

* one die roll,
* two coin tosses,
* drawing one card,
* drawing two balls from an urn.

The program should then:

1. display the sample space,
2. allow the user to define events,
3. display unions, intersections, and complements visually,
4. compute probabilities of the chosen events,
5. allow the user to specify a conditioning event,
6. display the conditional sample space and the value of conditional probability.

The visual style should be minimal and focused on clarity.
