# Task List 07 — Descriptive Statistics from Generated Data

## Introduction

In the previous task lists, probability was studied mainly through theoretical models: sample spaces, events, probability distributions, probability mass functions, density functions, cumulative distribution functions, conditional probability, independence, and Bayes’ formula.

In this task list we change the perspective.

Instead of starting from a fully specified probability model, we start from **data**.  
The data are not given directly. In each problem, students first run a short Python script that generates a reproducible dataset using a fixed random seed.

The generated data should then be treated as observed data.

The main question is no longer only:

> What is the probability according to a given mathematical model?

but also:

> What can we learn from data by summarizing, visualizing, and comparing observations?

This is the role of **descriptive statistics**.

In this list, students will practice:

- generating reproducible datasets,
- saving generated data to CSV files,
- constructing frequency tables,
- computing relative frequencies,
- interpreting empirical distributions,
- computing mean, median, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, and interquartile range,
- identifying outliers,
- drawing histograms, bar charts, boxplots, empirical cumulative distribution functions, and scatter plots,
- comparing groups,
- interpreting relationships between two variables,
- computing covariance and correlation,
- recognizing when a numerical summary may be misleading.

The purpose of this list is not only to compute statistics mechanically.  
Students should also interpret what the computed quantities mean in the context of the data.

Averages, standard deviations, correlations, and plots should always be connected with the real situation represented by the dataset.

---

## General Instructions

In each problem:

1. Run the given Python code.
2. Do not change the random seed.
3. Save the generated dataset as a CSV file.
4. Use the generated dataset to solve the tasks.
5. When possible, support numerical answers with plots.
6. Explain the meaning of your results in words.

Use the following Python libraries when needed:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

You may also use:

```python
df.head()
df.info()
df.describe()
df.value_counts()
df.groupby(...)
```

The random seed is fixed in every problem so that everyone obtains the same dataset.

# Problem 1 — Die Rolls and Empirical Distribution

In this problem, we observe many results of rolling a die.

The die is not assumed to be perfectly fair.  
The goal is to compare the observed empirical distribution with the theoretical distribution of a fair die.

## Generate the data

Run the following code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

rng = np.random.default_rng(701)

n = 1000

probabilities = [0.14, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.16, 0.19]

rolls = rng.choice(
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    size=n,
    p=probabilities
)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "trial": np.arange(1, n + 1),
    "roll": rolls
})

df["is_even"] = df["roll"] % 2 == 0
df["is_at_least_5"] = df["roll"] >= 5

df.to_csv("problem_01_die_rolls.csv", index=False)

df.head()
```

## Tasks

1. Describe what one row of the dataset represents.
2. Construct an absolute frequency table for the variable `roll`.
3. Construct a relative frequency table for the variable `roll`.
4. Draw a bar chart of the empirical distribution.
5. Compute the empirical probability of the following events:
   - the result is even,
   - the result is at least 5,
   - the result is equal to 6.
6. Compare the empirical distribution with the theoretical distribution of a fair die.
7. Explain why empirical frequencies do not have to be exactly equal to theoretical probabilities.
8. Decide whether the die appears to be fair based only on the generated data. Justify your answer.

)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "trial": np.arange(1, n + 1),
    "result": tosses
})

df["is_head"] = df["result"] == "H"

df["cumulative_heads"] = df["is_head"].cumsum()
df["relative_frequency_heads"] = df["cumulative_heads"] / df["trial"]

df.to_csv("problem_02_coin_tosses.csv", index=False)

df.head()
```

## Tasks

1. Describe the random experiment represented by the dataset.
2. Construct a frequency table for `result`.

# Final Problem — Short Statistical Report

Choose any three datasets generated in this task list.

For each chosen dataset, prepare a short statistical report.

The report should contain:

1. a short description of the data,
2. information about the number of observations and variables,
3. at least one frequency table,
4. at least one numerical summary,
5. at least one histogram or bar chart,
6. at least one boxplot, empirical CDF, or scatter plot,
7. one comparison between groups, if the dataset contains groups,
8. one interpretation involving empirical probability, conditional frequency, or correlation,
9. one warning about a possible misuse of a numerical summary,
10. a short conclusion written in words.

The report should not consist only of code and numerical output.  
Every computed statistic should be interpreted in the context of the data.
